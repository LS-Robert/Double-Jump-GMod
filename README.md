# Double Jump Script for Garry's Mod

This script enhances the gameplay experience in Garry's Mod by introducing a double jump feature, allowing players to execute a mid-air jump for an additional vertical boost.

## Features:

- **Airborne Elevation:** Grant players the ability to perform a double jump in mid-air.
- **Configurable Cooldown:** Fine-tune the cooldown time between double jumps using the console command `set_double_jump_cooldown`. Admins can adjust this setting to suit their server's gameplay dynamics.

## Usage Instructions:

1. Jump while in the air to activate the double jump feature.
2. Use the console command `set_double_jump_cooldown X` to set the cooldown time between double jumps (admins only).
